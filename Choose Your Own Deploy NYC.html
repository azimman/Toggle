Before the route can support this level of traffic, Spacelanes needs to build some more infrastructure.

To reduce the congestion, Telzey dials back the markers so that they only appear to every other ship. The route can handle half the traffic while Spacelanes gets the support systems in place for full traffic.

Because of the new-style markers, they only have to mark a planet once, and then multiple routes can use it, instead of having to leave multiple almost-identical markers. The automated switching means that Toggle has less manual labor to do, and can spend more time on their mycology experiments.

If there were no space travelers, Toggle wouldn&#39;t have a job. But different travelers care about different things. Some of them want to get where they&#39;re going as fast as possible, and some want to route around black-hole turbulence. Some travelers want to see as many planets as they can.

Any spaceperson will tell you that you don&#39;t have to turn your rockets all the way on or all the way off to get where you&#39;re going. Steady, constant acceleration will do the trick and leave you more room for emergency manuevering.

When we launch a product, we can start by showing it just to the people who signed up as beta testers, or just to 10% of our user base. That gives us some time to make sure there aren&#39;t any unexpected effects at a larger scale, and that our infrastructure is up to the load. We can gradually increase the roll-out.

Not everyone is excited about the amazing new features you&#39;ve added. In fact, some people are really resistant to change, because they&#39;ve built a whole infrastructure around the way it used to be.

Rather than force them to upgrade, you can create a non-upgrading group, and leave them out of all the new stuff so they can keep doing their custom things.

Your feature may be banned in some countries. Or you may need to use a different method of data collection. What if you need to comply with COPPA, to track how children use your site?

Your deployment can have room for all these variables in the same codebase, if you take the time to design your features to be able to operate independently as they are switched on and off.

Think of your features like microservices - nothing is going to need to call all of them except a test harness.

If you&#39;ve ever had to have an extended negotiation with someone because you have a merge conflict, you know why it&#39;s best to do trunk development or very short-lived branches. Trunk development seems risky until you realize that you have total control over what is actually released.
&lt;!-- Merge spaghetti--&gt;

Sometimes it&#39;s hard keep a bunch of branches straight in space-time. That&#39;s why Toggle wishes that everyone used the same spacelane, but Toggle doesn&#39;t always get their way.

Sometimes things go wrong, and we usually reach for the roll-back in that case. If we just put everything back the way it was, it /should/ work again.

But what if instead of rolling back, you could roll foward? Keep all the good parts of the deploy, and just turn off the one feature that is failing, rather than everything? That would be better.

On a run, sometimes Toggle will put out a flag that doesn&#39;t work right. They don&#39;t have have to go pull out all the flags from that run, just the one that&#39;s not working.

We can use feature flags to switch from our branding to the customer&#39;s branding without having to have an entirely different branch that may get out of sync.

There isn&#39;t enough provisioning along this route for the amount of traffic trying to take it. Before the route can support this level of traffic, Spacelanes needs to build some more infrastructure.
