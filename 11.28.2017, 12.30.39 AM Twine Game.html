When we launch a product, we can start by showing it just to the people who signed up as beta testers, or just to 10% of our user base. That gives us some time to make sure there aren&#x27;t any unexpected effects at a larger scale, and that our infrastructure is up to the load. We can gradually increase the roll-out.

If there were no space travelers, Toggle wouldn&#x27;t have a job. But different travelers care about different things. Some of them want to get where they&#x27;re going as fast as possible, and some want to route around black-hole turbulence. Some travelers want to see as many planets as they can.

Before you send someone out into deep space, you have them spend some time tooling around the solar system.

In the same way, you may want to test a product internally before you show it to the outside world. Use a feature toggle to turn it on only for the people who are logged in from your company IP addresses.

Any spaceperson will tell you that you don&#x27;t have to turn your rockets all the way on or all the way off to get where you&#x27;re going. Steady, constant acceleration will do the trick and leave you more room for emergency manuevering.

When we launch a product, we can start by showing it just to the people who signed up as beta testers, or just to 10% of our user base. That gives us some time to make sure there aren&#x27;t any unexpected effects at a larger scale, and that our infrastructure is up to the load. We can gradually increase the roll-out.

Not everyone is excited about the amazing new features you&#x27;ve added. In fact, some people are really resistant to change, because they&#x27;ve built a whole infrastructure around the way it used to be.

Rather than force them to upgrade, you can create a non-upgrading group, and leave them out of all the new stuff so they can keep doing their custom things.

Your feature may be banned in some countries. Or you may need to use a different method of data collection. What if you need to comply with COPPA, to track how children use your site?

Your deployment can have room for all these variables in the same codebase, if you take the time to design your features to be able to operate independently as they are switched on and off.

Think of your features like microservices - nothing is going to need to call all of them except a test harness.

Toggle hopes they don&#x27;t have to eat dogfood on their mission! But developers have made a joke about this - their dogfood (code) is so delicious that they would eat it like human food.

You can turn on a feature just for yourself while you&#x27;re figuring it out. Just create the flag and add yourself as the only person who can see it.

If you&#x27;ve ever had to have an extended negotiation with someone because you have a merge conflict, you know why it&#x27;s best to do trunk development or very short-lived branches. Trunk development seems risky until you realize that you have total control over what is actually released.

Sometimes it&#x27;s hard keep a bunch of branches straight in space-time. That&#x27;s why Toggle wishes that everyone used the same spacelane, but Toggle doesn&#x27;t always get their way.

How do you want to get paid? Toggle gets paid in bars of gold-pressed latinum, but you may want to switch your prices from US dollars to Canadian dolllars, or yen or pesos or euros. 

The user&#x27;s browser probably already knows where they are, so we just need to send them the price in the correct currency.

Super-luxury spaceliners are fast and comfortable, but they cost a lot to fly on. Toggle knows that if you&#x27;re willing to fly in a smaller cabin, you can save a lot of gold-pressed latinum. It&#x27;s the same spaceliner, but different experiences.

Sometimes we want our users to have different experiences, depending on what they paid for.

It&#x27;s helpful to have a tutorial the first time or two you use a product, but you don&#x27;t want it popping up Every. Single. Time. Use a feature flag to let users opt out of tutorials when they&#x27;re done.

Toggle has a lot of time to do video tutorials, but they&#x27;re really sick of the tutorial about how to use the video player.

Sometimes things go wrong, and we usually reach for the roll-back in that case. If we just put everything back the way it was, it /should/ work again.

But what if instead of rolling back, you could roll foward? Keep all the good parts of the deploy, and just turn off the one feature that is failing, rather than everything? That would be better.

On a run, sometimes Toggle will put out a flag that doesn&#x27;t work right. They don&#x27;t have have to go pull out all the flags from that run, just the one that&#x27;s not working.

Spacelane flags or markers are like those old-fashioned railroad switches. Toggle plants the markers on moons, planets, and asteroids to help guide space traffic along the fastest or safest routes.

Once Toggle has planted the markers, they can be changed from back in the home office without anyone being close to them, but Toggle needs to put them in place.

Toggle&#x27;s spacelane markers look like this:

Sometimes a client wants your product to look like they&#x27;ve made it. They want their branding and vocabulary to show up so the users have a consistent experience.

We can use feature flags to switch from our branding to the customer&#x27;s branding without having to have an entirely different branch that may get out of sync.
 
Toggle remembers a time they had to go replace a bunch of flags that were working, but had the wrong branding. They were pretty annoyed.

But at least nothing&#x27;s really lost, just...conflicted. I&#x27;m sure we can cherry-pick that.

After several weeks of work, a team finishes their sprint by sending Toggle or someone like them to test that the spacelane works, before they send everyone down it. Only Toggle&#x27;s ship can see the markers - they&#x27;re invisible to regular traffic. When the team is satisfied that the route is safe and stable, they turn on the markers so everyone can use the route.

Congratulations, team!

There are no conflicts, it&#x27;s passing all the tests, and Toggle says it&#x27;s faster than the current route. 

Telzey switches on her markers and the traffic *surges* through. It&#x27;s wonderful...except it isn&#x27;t. There isn&#x27;t enough provisioning along this route for the amount of traffic trying to take it. Before the route can support this level of traffic, Spacelanes needs to build some more infrastructure.

To reduce the congestion, Telzey dials back the markers so that they only appear to every other ship. The route can handle half the traffic while Spacelanes gets the support systems in place for full traffic.
